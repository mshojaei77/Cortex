Below is a step‐by‐step guide outlining how you can complete the entire website’s logic. This guide covers backend architecture with Python and FastAPI, vector search with Milvus, integration with language models via OpenAI and LangChain, storage and authentication using Supabase, and how the frontend interacts with all these components. Each step explains the design decisions and the best practices so you can build a high-quality, production-ready solution.

---

## 1. Define the Architecture & Requirements

- **Frontend (React/Next.js):**  
  – Use your existing Next.js project (see your file in `/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`) as the user interface.  
  – Provides functionalities such as chat, file upload for PDFs, listing sources, toggling views, and displaying file details.

- **Backend (FastAPI):**  
  – Use FastAPI as your main API server, exposing endpoints for chat queries, file uploading, source deletion, health checks, etc.  
  – Modularize code into different endpoint files if needed.

- **Vector Search & Storage (Milvus):**  
  – Use Milvus to store and search document embeddings.  
  – Use best practices (e.g., batching inserts, re-indexing, error handling).

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) + LLM:**  
  – Connect to OpenAI (or LangChain wrappers) to generate responses.  
  – Use LangChain to create chains that combine document retrieval with LLM prompting.

- **User Authentication & Data Storage (Supabase):**  
  – Integrate Supabase for secure user authentication, file metadata storage, and real-time updates if necessary.
  – You can also store additional user details and conversation histories.

- **Additional Tools & Best Practices:**  
  – Use Pydantic for data validation and schema enforcement.  
  – Use asynchronous programming (async/await) for I/O-bound endpoints.  
  – Apply CORS and security middleware.  
  – Write extensive logging and error handling.

---

## 2. Setup the Environment

- **Python Setup:**
  - Create a Python virtual environment.
  - Install necessary libraries:
    - FastAPI, uvicorn
    - Pydantic, aiofiles
    - Milvus (pymilvus)
    - OpenAI, LangChain (or any relevant library)
    - supabase-py (if available) or use Supabase’s REST API
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn aiofiles pymilvus openai langchain supabase
    ```

- **Frontend Setup:**
  - Ensure your Next.js/React project is configured.  
  - Install react-icons and other required packages.

- **Supabase Setup:**
  - Create a Supabase project and note your API keys.
  - Setup tables for users, file metadata, and saved conversations.
  - Optionally use Supabase’s Auth client on the frontend.

- **Milvus:**
  - Set up a Milvus server instance (locally or on the cloud).
  - Create and test a collection for document embeddings.

---

## 3. Implement the Core Backend Logic

### 3.1. Chat Endpoint (RAG Logic)

- **Goals:**  
  – Receive a query along with conversation history.  
  – Process the history into a context block (if needed) and combine with the user query.  
  – Pre-process documents to ensure that Milvus has recent embeddings.
  – Use Milvus to fetch the most relevant document chunks.
  – Build a complete prompt and forward it to OpenAI/LangChain to generate an answer.
  – Return the answer along with metadata (prompt used, citations, and parameters).

- **Implementation:**  
  You already have a solid starting point in your `/chat` endpoint. Best practices include:
  - Backing up original settings and restoring them in a `finally` block.
  - Verifying all overrides using Pydantic validators.
  - Logging or tracking history if needed.

### 3.2. Query Endpoint

- **Goals:**  
  – A simpler endpoint for quick answers without much context.
  – Validate input with Pydantic and return the answer with a timestamp.

### 3.3. File Upload & PDF Processing

- **Goals:**  
  – Handle file upload safely and asynchronously (using aiofiles).
  – Validate that only PDFs are accepted.
  – Sanitize file names and store them in a user-specific folder.
  – Once uploaded, trigger a background process (using FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks) that:
    • Processes the PDF, extracting text.
    • Converts the text into document embeddings.
    • Inserts new document vectors into Milvus.
  
- **Implementation Example:**  
  In your `/upload` endpoint, you have a file validation and file chunking upload process. The background task function (`process_user_pdf`) should then use your document processor to extract the text, compute embeddings (possibly with LangChain or OpenAI API), and then insert them into Milvus.

### 3.4. Source Deletion Endpoint

- **Goals:**  
  – Allow deletion of a source file.
  – Remove the file from disk as well as from the vector store (Milvus).
  – Sanitize input fields and return a clear response.

- **Implementation Example:**  
  Check that the file exists in the user’s document directory and then remove it. Add logic later to also remove the entry from your Milvus collection (if applicable).

---

## 4. Bridge to LLM and LangChain

- **LLM Generation:**  
  – Build a module that wraps the OpenAI API (or LangChain) to generate answers based on a prompt.  
  – Structure your prompt to include a “citation block” if needed.  
  – Return a structured answer including citations.
  
- **LangChain Integration:**  
  – Use LangChain chains to combine the retrieval from Milvus with a structured prompt.
  – Example chain:  
    1. Retrieve context documents (using Milvus).
    2. Format the context into a prompt template.
    3. Send to OpenAI to generate an answer.
    4. Extract and format the citations.

---

## 5. Integrate Supabase for User Management & Data Persistence

- **User Authentication:**  
  – Implement Supabase Auth in your frontend to control login/signup.
  – On successful login, pass the authenticated user’s token to your FastAPI backend for further validation (JWT verification).

- **Data Storage with Supabase:**  
  – Use Supabase PostgreSQL to store metadata about uploaded sources, conversation logs, and user preferences.
  – Make sure endpoints (e.g., file upload, deletion) record metadata in Supabase.

- **Real-Time Features:**  
  – Optionally use Supabase’s real-time capabilities to update the list of sources when new PDFs are uploaded or deleted.

---

## 6. Tie Backend Endpoints to Frontend Actions

- **File Upload Button:**  
  – Clicking “Add Source” should trigger the file input.  
  – Submit the file and user_id (from Supabase) to the `/upload` endpoint using a POST request.

- **Chat Form:**  
  – When the user types a message, validate the input and call the `/chat` endpoint.  
  – Display the returned answer along with prompt details (if needed).

- **Source List and Actions:**  
  – Your list of sources is rendered dynamically.  
  – Each source should have buttons for “Show Info”, “Download”, “Delete” etc., which call their respective endpoints.
  – Allow selection and bulk actions if needed.

- **Settings and Model Selector:**  
  – Configure your selector to choose the model (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.) and set it in the FastAPI settings for the chat endpoint.

---

## 7. Testing & Best Practices

- **Unit and Integration Tests:**  
  – Write tests for each FastAPI endpoint using pytest and HTTPX.
  – Validate file upload, deletion, and chat endpoints with appropriate inputs.

- **Error Handling and Logging:**  
  – Add logging at key points (e.g., PDF processing, Milvus insertion, API calls).
  – Use structured error messages and HTTP status codes.

- **Security Considerations:**  
  – Use proper CORS settings.
  – Secure file storage (limit file sizes, sanitize names, etc.).
  – Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
  – Ensure the API keys (OpenAI, Supabase keys) are stored securely (e.g., environment variables).

- **Deployment:**  
  – Dockerize your FastAPI service.
  – Use a process manager (like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers) in production.
  – Configure proper scaling for Milvus and Supabase if needed.

### Example: FastAPI Chat Endpoint in main.py

```python:main.py
@app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat_endpoint(request: ChatRequest):
    """
    Enhanced chat endpoint that processes query, conversation history and parameters override.
    """
    try:
        original_settings = { ... }  # Backup current settings
        parameters_used = {}
        try:
            # Apply parameter overrides if provided
            if request.temperature is not None:
                rag_system.settings.llm_temperature = request.temperature
                parameters_used["temperature"] = request.temperature
            # (repeat for top_k, query_expansion, re_ranking)

            # Build conversation history context
            conversation_prefix = ""
            if request.history:
                conversation_prefix = "Conversation History:\n" + "\n".join(
                    f"{msg.role}: {msg.content}" for msg in request.history
                ) + "\n\n"
            combined_query = conversation_prefix + "User Question: " + request.query
            
            # Document processing and Milvus setup here
            existing_docs = rag_system.milvus_manager.get_existing_docs()
            rag_system.doc_processor.process_pdfs(existing_docs=existing_docs)
            # ... Insert new documents if any
            
            prompt = rag_system.milvus_manager.perform_query(combined_query, collection, rag_system.doc_processor.embeddings, top_k=rag_system.top_k)
            answer = rag_system.llm_generator.generate_answer(prompt)
            
            # Extract citations if available in the prompt
            citations = {}
            if "\nCitations:\n" in prompt:
                citations_block = prompt.split("\nCitations:\n")[-1]
                for line in citations_block.splitlines():
                    if line.strip():
                        parts = line.split(" ", 1)
                        if len(parts) == 2:
                            citations[parts[0]] = parts[1].strip()
            
            return ChatResponse(
                answer=answer,
                prompt_used=prompt,
                citations=citations,
                parameters_used=parameters_used,
                conversation_id=request.conversation_id
            )
        finally:
            # Restore original settings...
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Error processing request: {str(e)}")
```

### Example: PDF Upload Endpoint in main.py

```python:main.py
@app.post("/upload", summary="Upload PDF document")
async def upload_pdf(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, file: UploadFile = File(...), user_id: str = Form(...)):
    if file.content_type != "application/pdf":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid file type. Only PDF files are allowed.")
    
    upload_dir = os.path.join("data", "documents", user_id)
    os.makedirs(upload_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    original_filename = file.filename
    safe_filename = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]', '', original_filename)
    unique_filename = f"{uuid.uuid4().hex}_{safe_filename}"
    file_path = os.path.join(upload_dir, unique_filename)
    
    try:
        async with aiofiles.open(file_path, "wb") as out_file:
            while chunk := await file.read(1024 * 1024):
                await out_file.write(chunk)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Failed to upload file: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        await file.close()
    
    background_tasks.add_task(process_user_pdf, file_path, user_id)
    
    return {
        "detail": f"File '{unique_filename}' uploaded successfully for user {user_id}",
        "file_path": file_path,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

## 9. Final Considerations

- **Documentation:**  
  – Use FastAPI’s automatic docs for your endpoints (Swagger UI at `/docs` and ReDoc at `/redoc`).
  – Document the frontend’s API calls and set up comments in the code.

- **Monitoring and Analytics:**  
  – Implement logging for long-running tasks (e.g., PDF processing, Milvus queries).
  – Monitor health endpoints and error logs in production.

- **Scalability:**  
  – Consider containerizing with Docker.
  – Use serverless functions for parts of the pipeline if needed (e.g., Supabase functions).

By following these steps and best practices, you’ll be well on your way to completing the logic for your intelligent research companion website using Python, FastAPI, Supabase, Milvus, LangChain, and OpenAI. Each component is modular so you can iterate and improve as requirements evolve.
